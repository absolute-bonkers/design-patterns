## 🌟 The Singleton Solution: One and Only!

### *🚀 Why Singleton?*

*Ever felt overwhelmed by multiple copies of the same object cluttering your application? 🤯 <br/>
Picture this: you’re building a video game that requires a single game manager to track scores, or perhaps a logging
service that needs to maintain a consistent log file. <br/>
Introducing more instances only leads to confusion and potential errors—like trying to change channels on a TV with a
dozen remotes! 📺*

### 🦸‍♂️ The Singleton Superpower

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, no matter how many times you try to create it. Here’s
what makes it shine:

	•	Single Instance: Guarantees a single, global access point to that instance. Think of it as your favorite coffee shop—always the same barista serving your go-to order! ☕
	•	Controlled Access: Prevents the hassle of managing multiple instances and keeps your code tidy and efficient. You only need to refer to that one instance whenever you need it. 🧹
	•	Lazy Initialization: This pattern often creates the instance only when it’s needed, saving precious resources until that moment of truth! 💡

### 🛠️ Singleton Implementation Styles: Eager and Lazy

*When implementing the Singleton pattern, there are two common ways to control when the instance is created—each with
its own benefits!*

### ⚡ Eager Initialization

*In eager initialization, the Singleton instance is created as soon as the class is loaded into memory, ensuring that
it’s available from the get-go.*

- **Pros:** Simple to implement and thread-safe without synchronization.
- **Cons:** The instance is created even if it’s never used, potentially wasting resources.

#### 💻 Example:

*Here is an illustration of eager implementation.*<br/>
We have a **EagerDatabaseConnectionPool** service which is responsible to make connection to database (for demonstration),
Once instance is created it provides a ConnectionPool response.

Implementation Class:
*[EagerDatabaseConnectionPool.java](../dp-singleton/src/main/java/com/absolute/bonkers/singleton/eager/EagerDatabaseConnectionPool.java)*<br/>
Test Class:
*[EagerDatabaseConnectionPoolTest.java](../dp-singleton/src/test/java/com/absolute/bonkers/singleton/eager/EagerDatabaseConnectionPoolTest.java)*<br/>

### 💤 Lazy Initialization

*Lazy initialization defers the creation of the Singleton instance until it’s actually needed.<br/>
This is more resource-efficient but requires additional care for thread safety in multithreaded environments.*

- **Pros:** Saves resources by creating the instance only when needed.
- **Cons:** Requires synchronization in a multithreaded environment, which may introduce complexity.

#### 💻 Example:

*Here is an illustration of lazy implementation.*<br/>
We have a **LazyDatabaseConnectionPool** service which is responsible to make connection to database (for demonstration),
Once instance is created it provides a ConnectionPool response.

Implementation Class:
*[LazyDatabaseConnectionPool.java](../dp-singleton/src/main/java/com/absolute/bonkers/singleton/lazy/LazyDatabaseConnectionPool.java)*<br/>
Test Class:
*[LazyDatabaseConnectionPoolTest.java](../dp-singleton/src/test/java/com/absolute/bonkers/singleton/lazy/LazyDatabaseConnectionPoolTest.java)*<br/>

### 🧠 Which One to Use?

	•	If your Singleton is lightweight and used frequently, Eager Initialization might be the simpler and safer choice.
	•	If your Singleton involves heavier setup or is rarely used, consider Lazy Initialization to save resources.

### 🌈 Summary

*In the realm of coding, the Singleton pattern is your go-to strategy for managing resources effectively.<br/>
By ensuring that there’s only one instance to rule them all, you can say goodbye to chaos and hello to organized
code.<br/>
So, whether you’re building a game, managing configurations, or handling logging, remember the Singleton pattern to keep
your projects streamlined and efficient! 🌟✨*
